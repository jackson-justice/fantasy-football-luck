# Fantasy Football Luck Study

This project breaks down how lucky each fantasy football team actually was by
comparing **expected wins** (based on points scored) to **actual wins**. The goal
is to see who really earned their record and who got carried by luck.

## What this project does

- Loads weekly fantasy scores and season results.
- Calculates expected wins for every team using total points scored.
- Creates a "luck score" = actual wins minus expected wins.
- Generates visuals to show which teams overperformed or underperformed.
